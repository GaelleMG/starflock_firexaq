Agriculture and Atmosphere - NOTES


Bromine = pesticide, flame retardant

Chloride = bad for agri
(Chloride (Cl–) has traditionally been considered harmful to agriculture because of its toxic effects in saline soils and its antagonistic interaction with nitrate (NO3–), which impairs NO3– nutrition. It has been largely believed that Cl– antagonizes NO3– uptake and accumulation in higher plants, reducing crop yield.) https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj-0cLF4rv6AhXprIkEHdXBAIYQFnoECAQQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.frontiersin.org%2Farticles%2F10.3389%2Ffpls.2020.00442%2Ffull&usg=AOvVaw0SrWK-Gon0HJhKcFz7NKnE

Nitrate = good for agri
(Nitrates are chiefly produced to be used as fertilizers in agriculture because they have high solubility and biodegradability. The main nitrate fertilizers are ammonium, sodium, potassium, and calcium salts.)

Iodine = good for agri at low doses
(Iodine applied to soil increases biomass. Biomass increases at low doses. Toxic effect at higher doses. When not applied to soil in excess, iodine increases its concentration in edible vegetables)
